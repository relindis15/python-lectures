# You are developing a program for a teacher to grade their students' exams. The program #should prompt the teacher to enter the number of questions on the exam, the number of #questions the student answered correctly, and the number of points each question is #worth. The program should then calculate the student's grade as a percentage, and print #out a message indicating whether the student passed or failed the exam.
# solution
# get the number of questions in the exams, the number of answered questions,the number #correctly answered questions
# give a formula on how to calculate the students marks or grade by nultiplying correct #answers to the number of points assigned per question. average you sum and divide by #total number of subjects and divide by 100
# check the conditional statements if the student passed or failed
